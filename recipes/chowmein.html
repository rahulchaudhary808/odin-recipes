    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200 grams of chow mein noodles (egg noodles or wheat noodles)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 small carrot, julienned</li>
        <li>1 bell pepper (any color), thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup cabbage, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup bean sprouts (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Green onions, chopped for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the Noodles:</strong>
            Boil a large pot of water and cook the chow mein noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and
            rinse the noodles under cold water to stop them from cooking further. Set aside.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong>
            In a small bowl, mix the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, salt, and pepper. Set this sauce aside.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Cook the Vegetables and Noodles:</strong>
            Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic and sliced
            onion. Stir-fry for a minute until they become fragrant and slightly softened. Add the julienned carrot,
            bell pepper, and cabbage. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until the vegetables are slightly tender but still crisp.
            If using bean sprouts, add them now and stir-fry for another minute.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Combine Everything:</strong>
            Add the cooked and drained noodles to the skillet with the vegetables. Pour the sauce over the noodles and
            vegetables.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Stir-Fry:</strong>
            Toss everything together using a pair of tongs or chopsticks. Stir-fry for an additional 2-3 minutes,
            ensuring the sauce is evenly distributed and the noodles are heated through.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Taste and Adjust:</strong>
            Taste the chow mein and adjust the seasoning by adding more soy sauce, oyster sauce, salt, or pepper if
            needed.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
            Once the noodles and vegetables are well-cooked and coated with the sauce, transfer the chow mein to serving
            plates. Garnish with chopped green onions, if desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
