    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Prepared gundruk (fermented leafy greens)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Onion, sliced</li>
        <li>Garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Green chilies, chopped (adjust to your spice preference)</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Turmeric powder, a pinch (optional)</li>
        <li>Water, as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare Gundruk:</strong>
            If you have dried gundruk, soak a small portion in water for about 15-20 minutes until it softens. Rinse it
            a couple of times to remove excess salt. Squeeze out any excess water.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Heat Oil:</strong>
            Heat a pan or skillet over medium heat and add a couple of tablespoons of vegetable oil.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Sauté Aromatics:</strong>
            Add the sliced onions and minced garlic to the hot oil. Sauté until the onions turn translucent.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Add Green Chilies:</strong>
            Toss in the chopped green chilies and sauté for a minute or two. Adjust the amount of chilies to your
            desired level of spiciness.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Add Gundruk:</strong>
            Add the prepared gundruk to the pan. Stir-fry for a few minutes, allowing the gundruk to absorb the flavors
            of the aromatics.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Season:</strong>
            Season the gundruk with salt to taste. Be mindful of the salt as gundruk can be salty due to the
            fermentation process. You can add a pinch of turmeric for color if you like.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Add Water:</strong>
            If the gundruk appears too dry or you want a bit of gravy, you can add a small amount of water. Start with a
            few tablespoons and adjust as needed. This will create a flavorful broth.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Simmer:</strong>
            Cover the pan and simmer the gundruk for about 5-10 minutes, or until it is cooked to your preferred level
            of tenderness.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Taste and Adjust:</strong>
            Taste the gundruk and adjust the seasoning if necessary. You can add more salt or chilies according to your
            taste.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
            Once the gundruk is cooked and the flavors are well-incorporated, remove it from the heat.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
            Serve the cooked gundruk as a side dish with steamed rice or as a complement to other Nepali or South Asian
            dishes.
        </li>
