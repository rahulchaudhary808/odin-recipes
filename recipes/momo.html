        <li>1/2 teaspoon soy sauce (optional)</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>For the dipping sauce:</h4>
    <ul>

        <li>2-3 tablespoons chili sauce</li>
        <li>1-2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the dough:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Gradually add water and knead the dough until it's smooth and pliable. Cover it with a damp cloth and
                let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Prepare the filling:</strong></li>
        <ul>

            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
            <li>Add minced garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Saut√© for a minute or until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add chopped onions and cook until they turn translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the finely chopped or grated vegetables and cook for a few minutes until they are soft.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>You can also add soy sauce and vinegar if desired.</li>
            <li>Let the filling cool completely.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Assemble the momos:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Divide the rested dough into small, equal-sized balls and roll them into thin circles, about 4-5 inches
                in diameter.</li>
            <li>Place a spoonful of the vegetable filling in the center of each circle.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Fold and shape the momos:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Fold the circle in half, creating a half-moon shape.</li>
            <li>Pinch the edges together to seal the momo. You can create pleats along the edges to make them look
                attractive.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Steam the momos:</strong></li>
        <ul>

            <li>Place the momos in a greased steamer and steam for about 15-20 minutes or until the momos are cooked
                through.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Prepare the dipping sauce:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Mix tomato ketchup, chili sauce, minced garlic, soy sauce, and salt in a bowl to make the sauce.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Serve the momos hot with the dipping sauce.</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Enjoy your homemade momos! You can also experiment with different fillings, such as ground meat or other
        vegetables,
        to create your favorite variations.
